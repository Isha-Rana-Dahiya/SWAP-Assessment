# SWAP-Assessment
Form analysis

Step 1: Setup Environment
1.	Install Python (3.8+)
2.	Install required libraries:
3.	
pip install pdfplumber pandas numpy

Step 2: Create Solution Architecture
PDF Input → PDF Parser → Data Extractor → Score Calculator → Results

Step 3: Implementation Code
Create a Python script swap_scorer.py:
import pdfplumber
import re

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main(pdf_file)
Step 4: How to Use
1.	Save the PDF in the same directory as the script
2.	Run the script:
python swap_scorer.py
Step 5: Sample Output
==================================================
 Wellnes Score (Q1-12): 14/24
 Insomnia Score (Q13-20): 9/16
==================================================

Wellness Interpretation: Moderate
Insomnia Interpretation: Moderate
==================================================
Step 6: Accuracy Improvement Techniques
1.	Handling Checkbox Marks: For better accuracy with scanned forms, add OCR:
pip install pytesseract pdf2image
2.	Modify the extraction function to:
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
import pytesseract

def extract_responses_with_ocr(pdf_path):
    responses = {}
    images = convert_from_path(pdf_path)
    
    for i, image in enumerate(images):
        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, lang='tha+eng')
        # Process text same as before
        
    return responses
3.	Handling Position-based Extraction (for checkbox detection):
def detect_checkboxes(pdf_path):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        for page in pdf.pages:
            # Detect checkboxes based on their visual characteristics
            checkboxes = page.filter(lambda obj: (
                obj['object_type'] == 'rect' and 
                obj['width'] < 20 and 
                obj['height'] < 20
            ))
            
            # Process detected checkboxes
            for cb in checkboxes:
                # Get nearby text to determine question
                Pass
Step 7: Validation and Testing
1.	Create test PDFs with known answers
2.	Verify score calculations:
def test_scoring():
    test_cases = [
        # Wellness questions
        ({"1": "Better than usual"}, (0, 0)),
        ({"1": "Less than usual"}, (2, 0)),
        # Insomnia questions
        ({"13": "No problem"}, (0, 1)),
        ({"13": "Markedly delayed"}, (0, 2)),
        # Mixed
        ({"1": "Much less than usual", "13": "Serious problem or did not sleep at all"}, (2, 2))
    ]
    
    for responses, expected in test_cases:
        result = calculate_scores(responses)
        assert result == expected, f"Failed: {responses} => {result} (expected {expected})"
    
    print("All tests passed!")
Step 8: Deployment Options
1.	Local Execution: Run directly on any computer
2.	Web Interface (Free Options):
o	Use Streamlit: pip install streamlit
o	Create app.py:
import streamlit as st
st.title("SWAP Assessment Scorer")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload PDF", type="pdf")
if uploaded_file:
    with open("temp.pdf", "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())
    wellness, insomnia = main("temp.pdf")
    st.metric("Wellness Score", f"{wellness}/24")
    st.metric("Insomnia Score", f"{insomnia}/16")

Run with: streamlit run app.py
Key Advantages of This Approach:
1.	Zero Cost: Uses only free OSS tools
2.	High Accuracy:
o	Dual-language support (English + Thai)
o	Flexible option matching
o	Handles both text-based and OCR processing
3.	Easy Implementation:
o	Single Python script
o	No external services required
4.	Portable: Runs on Windows/Linux/Mac
5.	Extensible: Can add web interface or batch processing
For production use with multiple users, consider deploying the Streamlit app on free hosting like Streamlit Community Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces.
